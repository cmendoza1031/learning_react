This is my attempt at learning the react framework
by rebuilding the project here:

Github repo for reference and debugging:
https://github.com/jamezmca/reactjs-full-course

Steps:
    - download node.js and npm
    - run npm create vite@latest file_name
        *then click React
        *then JavaScript
            -> this will download necessary react packages
    - in src:
        * delete App.css file 
        * delete contents (not whole file) of index.css
        * take index.css from github repo above and paste here
    - 'npm i' should have already be run in /caffiend
        * then run 'npm run dev'
    -
